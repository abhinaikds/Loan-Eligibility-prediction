Loan Eligibility Prediction

1. Imported Dataset, Cleaned the Data(Handled null values and Duplicate values), seperated numerical data and categorical data.
2. Data Transformed by using OHE and scaler transformation, used Smote Transformation since it is Unbalanced data.
3. Applied Logistic regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, Naive Bayes,Gradient Boosting.
4. Since the accuracy part is only considered for this problem statement we are not going with precision, recall, f1_score. Here XG Boost gives the best accuracy hence the XG boost model is serilized.
5. Tested for Loan Eligibility.
